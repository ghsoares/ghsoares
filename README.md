## ‚≠ê Featured projects
### Tico
[Repository link](https://github.com/ghsoares/Tico)

Tico is a dynamic, procedural programming language with some features from Javascript and extra features, like additional arithmetic operators, operator overloading, static function default arguments, macros and more.

Tico was created as a test for my coding and logical skills, being simple but also interesting to know how tokenizers, parsers, ASTs works and how to create a programming language from scratch.

### React GD
[Repository link](https://github.com/ghsoares/ReactGD)

React GD is a extension made for [Godot engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), an open-source 3D and 2D game engine. This extension provides extra features to create reactive user interfaces with components and syntax simillar to JSX, but made specifically for game UIs made in Godot.

React GD was created as a personal need of a tool like this, but as no one was made one yet, I got ahead and developed it myself.
